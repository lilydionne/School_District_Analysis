# School Distric Analysis: Using Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
Maria is the chief data scientist for the city school system is responsible for analyzing information from various sources. For this project, she was tasked with organizing data from standard tests throughout the district to provide insights, performance trends, a patterns. This information will be used to make more informed decisions for further success at both the school and district levels. 

Unforunately, the school board notified Maria of academic dishonesty that could impact the results of her analysis, and therefore we were recently tasked with removing all ninth grader reading and math grades from a single school, Thomas High School. Following this update, we will review the school district analysis to determine how the removal of Thomas High School's ninth grade scores impacted the overall analysis.

When comparing the performance of Thomas High School to other schools, we can see that the removal of the 461 9th graders from the school summary did not impact their overall ranking, as they remain 2nd among the top schools in the district, as the overall passing scores dropped less than one percent.
